B-Spline Editor

I have written this tool to allow students to visualize B-Splines. It uses
explicit polynomial representations of B-Splines and can be debugged to
produce specific results. In addition, this tool provides a fast and reliable
way to let you create your own, custom B-Spline curves, provided you know
how they work.
